// Temporary type token re-exports to support imports from within Encore Web
// See: https://ghe.spotify.net/encore/web/blob/master/src/core/styles/mixins/type.tsx
// Once these mobile and desktop sizes are no longer in needed in Encore Web
// then these exports can be removed. This is to prevent Encore Web from having
// to import from e.g. '@spotify-internal/encore-foundation/desktop' which was
// causing tree-shaking and bundle size issues.
