/**
 * RepeatMode represents how a list should "repeat" (or if it shouldn't).

 * - `CONTEXT` denotes a repeating list: tracks are played back to back and the
 *   context returns to the first track after the last track has been played.
 * - `TRACK` denotes a single track list: when a track ends, the same track is
 *   played until the user explicitly hits the next or previous button.
